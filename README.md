The following project explores the Ames, Iowa housing dataset on Kaggle. First the dataset is cleaned. Then variables are summarized and plotted to understand characteristics. Finally, linear regression is compared with regularization to predict sales prices. This project was completed while I was a Data Science Immersive student at General Assembly in San Francisco.
